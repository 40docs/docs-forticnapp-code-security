# Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

Lacework FortiCNAPP's **IaC Security** statically analyzes cloud infrastructure templates like Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and Dockerfiles to detect misconfigurations before deployment.

---

## Getting Started with IaC Security

To get started, connect the **Code Security App** to your Git provider.

!!! tip "Proactive IaC Security"
    Integrating early in the SDLC lets you catch cloud misconfigurations before runtime—shifting security left.

---

## GitHub Integration

### Prerequisites

* **Admin access** to all repositories you plan to monitor
* Authorized installation of the GitHub **Lacework IaC Security** App

!!! note
    You can install the app directly via the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/apps/iacbot).

---

### Verifying Permissions

1. Go to GitHub → **Settings → Applications**
2. Under **Authorized OAuth Apps**, select **Lacework IaC Security**
3. Confirm the app has access to your GitHub organization
4. If not yet granted, click **Grant** next to your org
5. Sign out and back in to **Lacework FortiCNAPP**

---

### Configuring the GitHub Integration

1. Navigate to the **Lacework FortiCNAPP Console → IaC Security**
2. Select **GitHub** as your provider
3. Go to: [https://github.com/apps/iacbot](https://github.com/apps/iacbot)
4. Click **Configure**
5. Choose your GitHub **organization**
6. Select **All repositories** or pick specific ones
7. Review permissions and accept the **Terms of Service**

!!! success "You're Connected"
    Once installed, Lacework begins scanning supported IaC templates in your repo automatically.

## Hands-On

Follow this quick lab to trigger misconfig findings and see FortiCNAPP in action.

---

### Step 1: Create a New Project from the Template

```bash
gh repo create lab_forticnapp_code_security --template 40docs/lab_forticnapp_code_security --public
cd lab_forticnapp_code_security
```

This repo includes Terraform configs with real-world misconfigurations.

---

### Step 2: Install the GitHub App

1. Go to [https://github.com/apps/iacbot](https://github.com/apps/iacbot)
2. Click **Configure**
3. Select your **organization**
4. Choose **All** or **specific repositories**
5. Accept the permissions and Terms of Service

!!! warning "Permissions Required"
    You need **admin** access to install and authorize the app for your organization.

---

### Step 3: View IaC Scan Results

1. Open the **Lacework Console → Code Security → Repositories**
2. Click your repo to see:

   * ❌ Public S3 buckets
   * ❌ Subnets with public IPs
   * ✅ Inline file/line findings

!!! tip "Interactive Feedback"
    Click a finding to view exact source line, path, and fix recommendation.

---

### Step 4: Enforce Checks with Branch Protection

1. In your repo, go to **Settings → Branches**
2. Edit or create a rule for `main`
3. Enable:

   * ✅ Require pull request review
   * ✅ Require status checks to pass
4. Add the **Lacework Code Security** check (if available)

!!! info "Policy Enforcement"
    You can also create custom policies in Lacework to block merges based on critical misconfigurations.

---

### Optional: Scan Locally with the CLI

If you have the Lacework CLI:

```bash
lacework iac scan ./terraform --output iac-results.json
```

!!! note "Configure API Access First"
    Run `lacework configure` before scanning to set up your account keys.

---

### Sample Violations

```hcl
# terraform/resource_aws_s3_bucket.tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "public_bucket" {
  bucket = "lab-iac-demo-bucket"
  acl    = "public-read"  # ❌
}
```

```hcl
# terraform/resource_aws_subnet.tf
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true  # ❌
}
```

These trigger findings like:

* “S3 bucket should not be public”
* “Subnets should not assign public IPs by default”

---

## Best Practices

* ✅ Install the GitHub App to enable automated scans
* ✅ Use branch protection to enforce security gates
* ✅ Enable AutoFix to remediate issues with 1-click
* ✅ Run CLI scans locally to catch issues before pushing
